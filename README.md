# CompanianAI


### This project's [demo](https://companianai.vercel.app) will be unable to generate prompts!
*Reason*: The **OPEN AI API Key** I was using has been shut down on my account due to exceeding my current quota, and will not generate any more prompts, however this project will __work just fine__ when using locally or using your own API key

- You will get `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT` error when chatting with the companian (If you have any **official** OPEN AI key, please send a PR, It will be greatly appreciated üôè)
